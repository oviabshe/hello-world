# hello-world
This is a repository.  Idk what I'm doing.
My name is Alston.  I'm trying to learn about data science and programming and shit like that.
My goal is to become a social psychology researcher after I go to school for my PhD.
I'm currently only going for my master's degree, but I should finish in December.
